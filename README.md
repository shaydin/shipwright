A library to generate spaceships.

I was originally going to make a FTL clone, but when I sat down to draw a ship, I realized I wont have the time this 
week.  So I decided to make a tool to generate spaceships instead.


# Algorithm
The algorithm was based on David Bollinger's Pixel Spaceships.  My intention is to be able to scale it up to higher
resolution ships using open simplex noise for the random parts.

I am adding code to generate the internal rooms of the spaceship within its superstructure.  
My plan is then to cut hallways between the rooms like I did on my Salvage 2014 7drl.


The hope is that I can generate procedural space ships that follow certain design looks, but are varied enough.
